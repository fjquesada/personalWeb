Although with limitations, it is also starting to be considered in operations related to Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). This study aims to review the methods of DL applied in the field of altimetric spatial information in general, and DEMs in particular. Void Filling (VF), Super-Resolution (SR), landform classification and hydrography extraction are just some of the operations where traditional methods are being replaced by DL methods. Our review concludes that although these methods have great potential, there are aspects that need to be improved. More appropriate terrain information or algorithm parameterisation are some of the challenges that this methodology still needs to face.","tags":["Deep Learning","DEMs"],"title":"Deep Learning Methods applied to Digital Elevation Models: State of the Art","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francisco Moya","Francisco Jos√© Quesada Real","Luis Mart√≠nez","Fco Javier Estrella"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1690848e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1690848e3,"objectID":"f787dcb16a9e0f9d5fd5b83bf296efc2","permalink":"https://fjquesada.github.io/publication/moya23/","publishdate":"2023-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/moya23/","section":"publication","summary":"Nowadays, IoT devices, especially wearable devices, are commonly integrated into modern intelligent healthcare software. These devices enable medical practitioners to monitor pervasively patients' parameters outside the clinical environment. However, the ease of manipulating wearable devices and their data streams raises concerns regarding patient privacy and data trust. DLT offer solutions to enhance resistance against information manipulation and eliminate single points of failure. By leaveraging DLT, wearable-based solutions can be developed with a wider range of capabilities. This paper carries out an analysis of shortcomings, limitations, potential applications and needs in the medical domain, to introduce Phonendo 1.0, a DLT-IoT-based platform designed to capture data streams from wearable devices and publishing them on a DLTI.

However, none of them address the assessment of IS results from a positional perspective. In a field in which the positional aspect is critical, it seems reasonable to think that the quality associated with this aspect must be controlled. This paper presents an automatic positional accuracy assessment (PAA) method for assessing this quality component of the regions obtained by means of the application of a textural segmentation algorithm to a Very High Resolution (VHR) aerial image. This method is based on the comparison between the ideal segmentation and the computed segmentation by counting their differences. Therefore, it has the same conceptual principles as the automatic procedures used in the evaluation of the GI‚Äôs positional accuracy. As in any PAA method, there are two key aspects related to the sample that were addressed; (i) its size‚Äîspecifically, its influence on the uncertainty of the estimated accuracy values‚Äîand (ii) its categorization. Although the results obtained must be taken with caution, they made it clear that automatic PAA procedures, which are mainly applied to carry out the positional quality assessment of cartography, are valid for assessing the positional accuracy reached using other types of processes. Such is the case of the IS process presented in this study.","tags":["Positional Accuracy Assessment","Textural Imagery Segmentation"],"title":"Automatic Positional Accuracy Assessment of Imagery Segmentation Processes: A Case Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francisco Jos√© Quesada Real","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

However, they tend to rely on lexical knowledge and do not consider the specificities of domain grammar. In this paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of both lexical and grammatical linguistic domain knowledge for ontology matching through examples from multiple domains. We also provide an evaluation of the impact of such knowledge on a real-world problem of matching classifications of mental illnesses from the health domain. Our experimentation with two matcher tools that use very different matching mechanisms‚ÄîLogMap and SMATCH‚Äîshows that both lexical and grammatical knowledge improve matching results.","tags":["Ontology Matching","Domain-Knowledge","Domain Language","Domain Lexicon","Domain Grammar"],"title":"Using domain lexicon and grammar for ontology matching","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G√°bor Bella","Fiona McNeill","David Leoni","Francisco Jos√© Quesada Real","Fausto Giunchiglia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567555200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567555200,"objectID":"deb1d1b717908ee2d830683653e1a857","permalink":"https://fjquesada.github.io/publication/bella19/","publishdate":"2023-07-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bella19/","section":"publication","summary":"Natural language understanding is a key task in a wide range of applications targeting data interoperability or analytics. For the analysis of domain-specific data, specialised knowledge resources (terminologies, grammars, word vector models, lexical databases) are necessary. The heterogeneity of such resources is, however, a major obstacle to their efficient use, especially in combination. This paper presents the open-source Diversicon Framework that helps application developers in finding, integrating, and accessing lexical domain knowledge, both symbolic and statistical, in a unified manner. The major components of the framework are; (1) an API and domain knowledge model that allow applications to retrieve domain knowledge through a common interface from a diversity of resource types, (2) implementations of the API for some of the most commonly used symbolic and statistical knowledge sources, (3) a domain-aware knowledge base that helps integrate static lexico-semantic resources, and (4) an online catalogue that either hosts or links to the existing resources from multiple domains. Support for Diversicon is already integrated into two of the most popular ontology matcher applications, a fact that we exploit to validate the framework and demonstrate its use on a example study that evaluates the effect of several common-sense and domain knowledge resources on a medical ontology matching task.","tags":["Domain Knowledge","Lexical Knowledge","NLU"],"title":"Diversicon: Pluggable Lexical Domain Knowledge","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

This diversity is enriching in terms of expertise and approaches to tackle problems, however, it also provokes misunderstandings caused by semantic interoperability problems. There are some approaches which propose tackling these problems by using domain adaptation algorithms. Nevertheless, it is not trivial their application in emergency scenarios where the term ‚Äúdomain‚Äù is used in many different ways, not being clear either what it means or which domains are involved in these scenarios. In this paper, we identify semantic domains involved in emergency scenarios by analysing papers published in proceedings of ISCRAM and ISCRAM-med conferences. As a result, a categorisation of these domains has been developed, with the aim of providing a resource that can be used by domain adaptation algorithms to tackle problems such as those involving semantic interoperability.","tags":["Semantic Domains","Domain Adaptation","Emergency Domains Categorisation"],"title":"Identifying Semantic Domains in Emergency Scenarios","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francisco Jos√© Quesada Real","Fiona McNeill","G√°bor Bella","Alan Bundy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1496361600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1496361600,"objectID":"802d590878ff749e30c2d41291fa510b","permalink":"https://fjquesada.github.io/publication/quesada17/","publishdate":"2023-07-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/quesada17/","section":"publication","summary":"Emergency response scenarios are characterized by the participation of multiple agencies, which cooperate to control the situation and restore normality. These agencies can come from diverse areas of expertise which entails that they represent knowledge differently, using their own vocabularies and terminologies. This fact complicates the automation of the information-sharing process, creating problems such as ambiguity or specialisation. In this paper we present an approach to tackle these problems by domain-aware semantic matching. This method requires the formalisation of domain-specific terminologies which will be added to an existing system oriented to emergency response. Concretely, we have formalised terms from the UK Civil and Protection Terminology lexicon, which gathers some of the most common terms that UK agencies use in these scenarios.","tags":["Ontology Matching","Domain-specific Terminologies","Emergency Response"],"title":"Improving Dynamic Information Exchange in Emergency Response Scenarios","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paula Chocr√≥n","Dagmar Gromann","Francisco Jos√© Quesada Real"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1470096e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1470096e3,"objectID":"f162af7391ce175efe7bb2a992d54498","permalink":"https://fjquesada.github.io/publication/chocron16/","publishdate":"2023-07-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chocron16/","section":"publication","summary":"Crowdsourcing provides a valuable source of input that reflects the human diversity of domain knowledge. It has increasingly been used in ontology engineering and evaluation, however, few approaches consider different types of crowdsourcing for data acquisition. In this paper, we compare two crowdsourcing techniques - a mechanized labor-based task and a game-based approach - to acquire shared knowledge from which we semi-automatically build an ontology. This paper focuses on the first two steps of ontology engineering, the forming of concepts and their hierarchical relations. To this end, we adapt a distributional semantic and class-based word sense disambiguation approach and a knowledge-intensive tree traversal algorithm. Each step along the process and the final resources are evaluated manually and by a gold standard created from Wikipedia data. Our results show that the ontology resulting from data obtained with the mechanized labor-based approach provides a higher level of granularity than the game-based one.

The capture and processing of data are developed ubiquitously within mobile devices and ambient computers by means of peer to peer based on fuzzy temporal subscriptions. The main advantage of the use of fuzzy temporal subscriptions is that the information is received by a subscriber when it reaches a desired level of relevance for this subscriber, implying a decrease in the communication burden in the architecture.

Due to the cost to checking activity recognition approaches in real environments, usually, they use datasets generated from smart environments.

Although a wide variety of models and approaches have been proposed and developed to support consensus reaching processes, in large groups there are some important aspects that still require further study, such as the treatment of experts‚Äô behaviors that could hamper reaching the wanted agreement. More specifically, it would be necessary an approach to deal with experts properly, based on the overall behavior they present during the discussion process, as well as reinforcing repeated patterns of cooperative (or uncooperative) behavior adopted by experts. This paper presents an expert weighting methodology for consensus reaching processes in large-scale group decision making, that incorporates the use of uninorm aggregation operators. Such operators, which are characterized by their property of full reinforcement, are used in the proposed methodology to allow the experts‚Äô weighting based on their overall behavior during the consensus process and the behavior evolution across the time.

For these reasons, they may adopt distinct behaviors in order to achieve their own aims. Nonetheless, in such problems in general, specially those demanding a certain degree of consensus, each expert should comply with a collaboration contract in order to find a common solution for the decision problem.When decision groups are small, all experts usually attempt to fulfill the collaboration contract. However, nowadays technologies such as social media allow to make consensus-driven decisions with larger groups, in which many experts are involved, hence the possibility that some of them try to break the collaboration contract might be greater. In order to prevent the group solution from being biased by these experts, it is necessary to detect and manage their non-cooperative behaviors in this kind of problems. Recent proposals in the literature suggest managing non-cooperative behavior by reducing the importance of expert opinions. These proposals present drawbacks such as, the inability of an expert to recover his/her importance if behavior improves; and the lack of expert‚Äôs behavior measures across the time. This chapter introduces a methodology based on fuzzy sets and computing with words, with the aim of identifying and managing those experts whose behavior does not contribute to reach an agreement in consensus reaching processes. Such a methodology is characterized by allowing the importance recovery of experts and taking into account the evolution of their behavior across the time.","tags":["Large-scale GDM","CRP","CW","Behaviour Management"],"title":"Using computing with words for managing non-cooperative behaviors in large scale group decision making","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jorge Castro","Francisco Jos√© Quesada Real","Iv√°n Palomares","Luis Mart√≠nez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1438387200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1438387200,"objectID":"13f987c6f39d0f790869efc32cb9c2eb","permalink":"https://fjquesada.github.io/publication/castro15/","publishdate":"2023-07-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/castro15/","section":"publication","summary":"Recommender systems aim at filtering large amounts of information for users, providing them with those pieces of information which better meet their preferences or needs.

Within this context, group recommender systems address the problem of generating recommendations for groups of users who might have different interests. Although different aggregation processes have been extensively utilized in real-life applications to generate group recommendations, such processes do not guarantee that the list of products recommended to the group reflect a high agreement level among its members' individual preferences. Given the need for considering the added value of obtaining group recommendations under a high agreement level, this paper presents a novel group recommender system methodology that attempts to reach a high level of consensus among individual recommendations of group members.

Nevertheless, this approach presents some disadvantages in relation to response time, noise sensitivity and high storage requirements. The response time and storage requirements are closely related to the data size. This notion of data size is an important issue in sensor-based activity recognition given the vast amounts of data produced within smart environments. A wide range of prototype generation algorithms, which are designed for use with the nearest neighbor approach, have been proposed in the literature to reduce the size of the data set. These algorithms build new artificial prototypes, which represent the data, and subsequently lead to an increase in the accuracy of the nearest neighbor approach. In this work, we discuss the use of prototype generation algorithms and their effect on sensor-based activity recognition using the nearest neighbor approach to classify activities, reducing the response time. A range of prototype generation algorithms based on positioning adjustment, which reduce the data size, are evaluated in terms of accuracy and reduction. These approaches have been compared with the normal nearest neighbor approach, achieving similar accuracy and reducing the data size. Analysis of the results attained provide the basis for the use of prototype generation algorithms for sensor-based activity recognition to reduce the overall response time of the nearest neighbor approach.","tags":["Activity recognition","Data-driven","Nearest Neighbor (NN)","Prototype Generation (PG)","Response time"],"title":"Reducing the Response Time for Activity Recognition Through use of Prototype Generation Algorithms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francisco Moya","Jorge Castro","Francisco Jos√© Quesada Real"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1417478400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1417478400,"objectID":"2c0638ea3fa9cec017c67371b6d9e95c","permalink":"https://fjquesada.github.io/publication/moya14/","publishdate":"2023-07-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/moya14/","section":"publication","summary":"Recommender systems help users when large amounts of information are available,filtering those pieces of information by taking into account users' preferences or needs.

To do so, we focus on the consensus model considered, the multi-agent architecture designed to develop such a system, and the ontology used for reasoning and communication tasks.","tags":["Group Decision Making","Consensus Model","CRP","Multi-agent System"],"title":"COMAS: A multi-agent system for performing consensus processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francisco Mata","Pedro S√°nchez","Iv√°n Palomares","Francisco Jos√© Quesada Real","Luis Mart√≠nez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1288656e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1288656e3,"objectID":"8f9c69379deeafca48caa98eb6523f75","permalink":"https://fjquesada.github.io/publication/mata10/","publishdate":"2023-07-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mata10/","section":"publication","summary":"In group decision making problems is common the necessity of achieving a consensus before making a decision. Many consensus reaching processes have been introduced in the literature but not many intelligent systems have finally been implemented to deal with such processes. In this contribution an initial prototype of a consensus support system supported on a multi-agent paradigm is presented, showing the system architecture (set of agents, behaviours and relationships) and a preliminary ontology to represent the problem knowledge and used for the agent communication.","tags":["Ontology","Multi-Agent System","CRP"],"title":"COMAS: A consensus multi-agent based system","type":"publication"}]
