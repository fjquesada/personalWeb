abstract: Emergency scenarios are characterised by the participation of multiple and diverse organisations which come from different areas. This diversity is enriching in terms of expertise and approaches to tackle problems, however, it also provokes misunderstandings caused by semantic interoperability problems. There are some approaches which propose tackling these problems by using domain adaptation algorithms. Nevertheless, it is not trivial their application in emergency scenarios where the term “domain” is used in many different ways, not being clear either what it means or which domains are involved in these scenarios. In this paper, we identify semantic domains involved in emergency scenarios by analysing papers published in proceedings of ISCRAM and ISCRAM-med conferences. As a result, a categorisation of these domains has been developed, with the aim of providing a resource that can be used by domain adaptation algorithms to tackle problems such as those involving semantic interoperability.
