abstract: In group decision making problems is common the necessity of achieving a consensus before making a decision. Many consensus reaching processes have been introduced in the literature but not many intelligent systems have finally been implemented to deal with such processes. In this contribution an initial prototype of a consensus support system supported on a multi-agent paradigm is presented, showing the system architecture (set of agents, behaviours and relationships) and a preliminary ontology to represent the problem knowledge and used for the agent communication.
